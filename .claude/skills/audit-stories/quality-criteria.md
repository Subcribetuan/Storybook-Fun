# Children's Book Quality Criteria Reference
## Research-Backed Standards for Ages 3-7

## 1. Language & Readability

### Word Count Benchmarks
- Ages 3-4: 100-300 words total
- Ages 4-6: 300-600 words (picture book sweet spot)
- Ages 6-7: 600-1,000 words maximum
- Bedtime specifically: 5-10 minutes of reading time

### Sentence Construction
- Short and declarative (8-12 words average)
- 1-2 sentences per page spread for younger children
- Vary length for natural read-aloud rhythm
- Every sentence earns its place

### Vocabulary
- Core vocabulary from Dolch sight words (Pre-K through Grade 1)
- 1-3 "stretch" words per story, supported by context
- Concrete, specific nouns preferred over abstract
- Sensory/onomatopoeic words welcomed (swoosh, crinkle, velvety)
- No condescension or baby talk

### Read-Aloud Quality
- Reads naturally when spoken aloud (THE primary test)
- Phonetically pleasing sounds together
- Prose has rhythm through sentence variation

## 2. Story Structure

### Fundamental Architecture
- Clear three-act structure: setup, problem/rising tension, resolution
- Beginning establishes who/where/what within first page
- Problem introduced early
- Ending is satisfying with emotional completion

### The Rule of Three
- Repetition structures come in threes
- Each repetition escalates slightly
- Third instance provides twist or resolution
- Clear enough for children to anticipate and participate

### Pacing
- Story moves forward on every page
- Each page turn creates micro-reason to continue
- For bedtime: pacing DECELERATES in final third
- No subplots; one character, one problem, one thread

## 3. Themes & Content

### Appropriate Themes (Ages 3-7)
- Friendship, sharing, inclusion
- Family relationships (varied structures)
- Overcoming age-appropriate fears (dark, new situations, being alone)
- First experiences (school, sibling, moving)
- Curiosity, exploration, wonder
- Fairness, kindness, empathy
- Identity, belonging, self-worth

### Content Boundaries
- No graphic violence or death (especially parental)
- No profanity or crude language
- No adult romantic content
- No unresolvable existential threats
- Conflict is child-scaled
- Villains/antagonists neutralized by end

### Handling Difficult Themes
- Use metaphor or animal characters for difficult topics
- Every difficult topic has a supportive adult figure
- Fear stories end with fear normalized, named, partially resolved
- Humor used thoughtfully to ease tension
- Never at expense of child's real feelings

## 4. Emotional Safety

### Fear and Anxiety
- Scary elements framed as manageable and temporary
- Stories model specific coping strategies
- Characters show it is normal to feel scared/worried/sad
- Message: the child is NOT alone
- Stories end with empowerment, not just adult reassurance
- Child character solves or faces the problem

### Transitions
- Acknowledge child's perspective first
- Feelings validated before being resolved
- Resolution shows child adapting and finding comfort
- Parental separation stories: parent ALWAYS comes back

### Emotional Honesty
- Characters express full range of emotions without shame
- Show rather than tell emotional states
- No forced artificial happiness
- Children see their own feelings mirrored

## 5. Character Development

### Protagonist
- Child or child-like character at reader's age
- One clearly defined want or goal
- At least one relatable flaw or limitation
- Solves their own problem (adult doesn't rescue at climax)
- Changes, grows, or learns something by end
- Consistent voice and behavior

### Supporting Characters
- Max 2-3 to avoid confusion
- Each has distinct, memorable trait
- Adults as caring background, not drivers of action

## 6. Bedtime-Specific Requirements

### Sleep Architecture Alignment
- Emotional arc mirrors sleep transition: engaged opening, gentle middle, quiet resolution
- Final pages lead toward rest/warmth/sleep
- NO plot twists, cliffhangers, or unresolved conflict at end
- Ending leaves child feeling safe, loved, at peace

### Calming Language
- Overall register is warm, gentle, reassuring
- Language in final third decelerates: shorter sentences, softer sounds
- Descriptions of coziness (blankets, stars, night sounds)
- Natural sleep imagery present
- NO sudden loud action in final pages

### Wind-Down Pacing
- Read well at 90 words per minute or slower
- Narrative energy descends (not climaxes) at end
- Repetitive, slightly hypnotic refrains in final pages

### Sleep Cue Potential
- Works as a nightly ritual
- Predictable language allows recognition and relaxation
- Does NOT require active problem-solving at bedtime

## 7. Educational Value (SEL)

### Emotional Regulation
- Models two-step process: (1) identify emotion, (2) manage it
- Characters demonstrate empathy
- At least one scene showing choice about emotional response
- Vocabulary for emotions beyond happy/sad

### Social Skills
- Models positive behavior: sharing, listening, apologizing, helping
- Conflict resolved through communication, not dominance

### Problem-Solving
- Character tries, fails, tries again (growth mindset)
- Solutions from character's own resources
- Rewards persistence, courage, or kindness

## 8. Diversity & Representation

### Mirrors and Windows (Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop)
- Mirror: children from represented backgrounds see themselves
- Window: children see humanity different from their own
- Both have equal dignity

### Best Practices
- Characters shown through full humanity, not just identity
- Cultural details specific and accurate
- Diversity is NOT the conflict
- Avoid tokenism, stereotypes, savior dynamics

## 9. Length & Format

### Total Length
- Ages 3-4: 100-300 words, 3-4 pages
- Ages 4-6: 300-600 words, 5-7 pages
- Ages 6-7: up to 1,000 words, 7-9 pages
- Bedtime read-aloud: 5-10 min (ages 3-5), up to 15 min (ages 6-7)

### Text Per Page
- 1-2 sentences for youngest readers
- Max one short paragraph for older children
- Each page processable in natural reading time

## 10. Engagement

### Participation Design
- Repeated phrases invite join-in
- Predictable patterns after 2 cycles
- Sound words (onomatopoeia) for child participation
- Physical participation opportunities

### Sensory Language
- At least one scene with rich sensory detail
- Specific and evocative imagery
- Fantastical elements spark wonder
- Descriptions work even without illustrations

### Re-Readability
- Holds up to repeated readings
- New discoveries on re-read
- Becomes ritualistic with repetition
- Children ask for it by name (strongest quality signal)

## Scoring Guide

- **5/5**: Exceptional. Sets high standard. Could be published.
- **4/5**: Very Good. Meets standards with minor notes.
- **3/5**: Good. Meets basic standards. Room for enhancement.
- **2/5**: Fair. Notable gaps needing attention.
- **1/5**: Needs Work. Significant concerns.

## Hard Disqualifiers

- Unresolved threat/death/grief without resolution
- Adult solves child's problem at climax
- Cliffhanger or unresolved conflict (for bedtime)
- Violence, profanity, or adult content
- Stereotyping as primary character trait
- Over 1,000 words for ages 3-6 without natural breaks
