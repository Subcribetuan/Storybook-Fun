      { text: `Once upon a time, in a cozy house on a quiet street, there lived two brothers.\n\nThe big brother was named Christopher. He was strong and brave, and he loved to explore.\n\nThe little brother was named Benjamine. He was curious and silly, and he loved to follow Christopher everywhere.` },
      { text: `One evening, Mommy and Daddy tucked them into their big, warm bed together. Daddy pulled the blanket up to their chins — tuck, tuck, tuck — and kissed them both on the forehead.\n\n"We'll be right here," Daddy said. "And later tonight, we'll come snuggle with you."\n\n"But what if it's dark?" whispered Benjamine.\n\n"What if it's too quiet?" whispered Christopher.\n\nDaddy smiled. "You have each other. And that's a very powerful thing."` },
      { text: `Then Daddy turned off the light, and the room went dark and still, and the door closed with a gentle click.\n\nAnd that's when the magic happened.\n\nBenjamine reached over and held Christopher's hand.\n\nAnd the moment their fingers touched — whoooosh — the blanket began to glow. Soft, golden light floated up from the sheets like tiny fireflies, swirling around the room.` },
      { text: `"Whoa," said Christopher.\n\n"Whoa!" said Benjamine.\n\nThe blanket lifted — just a little — and became a tent. A great, billowing tent made of stars and moonlight. Inside, the bed wasn't a bed anymore.\n\nIt was a ship. A ship sailing on a silver sea, under a sky so full of stars they looked like spilled glitter.` },
      { text: `"Welcome aboard, brave brothers!" said a voice.\n\nSitting on the mast was a tiny owl with round golden glasses and a scarf that was way too long for him.\n\n"My name is Oliver," said the owl. "And I've been waiting for you."\n\n"You see, every night, when two brave children lie down together in their bed, they unlock the Night Sea. But it only works if they're together. One brother alone can't do it. It takes two."` },
      { text: `Oliver pointed toward the horizon, where a soft, golden light was glowing.\n\n"That is the Island of Safe Dreams. It's where all the best dreams are made. And tonight, you two get to pick yours."\n\nThe silver sea was calm and kind. Little fish with glowing fins jumped alongside their ship, and the waves made a sound like someone whispering shhhhh, shhhhh, shhhhh.` },
      { text: `"Are there any monsters in the water?" Benjamine asked quietly.\n\nOliver laughed. "There used to be a monster. A big, grumbly shadow called The Worried Wobble. He liked to make children feel scared at nighttime."\n\n"But two brave children — just like you — held hands one night and sailed right past him. And when The Worried Wobble saw that they weren't alone — that they had each other — he got smaller and smaller until the wind blew him away."\n\n"You mean... he's scared of US?" said Christopher.\n\n"Absolutely terrified," said Oliver with a wink.` },
      { text: `On the Island of Safe Dreams, the sand was softer than pillows and the trees chimed like tiny bells.\n\n"You each get to pick one dream for tonight. Close your eyes and think of the happiest thing you can imagine."\n\nTwo glowing orbs floated in front of them — one blue, one gold.\n\n"Those are your dreams," said Oliver. "They'll be waiting for you the moment you fall asleep."` },
      { text: `The ship sailed them back. The stars dimmed one by one. The blanket tucked around them again.\n\n"Will you be here tomorrow night?" asked Christopher.\n\n"Every night," said Oliver. "Every single night you're brave enough to lie down together."\n\n"Your Mommy and Daddy? They sailed this same sea once. That's why they know you'll be okay. And later, when they come to sleep beside you, they'll be joining you on the island. You just get there first."\n\nAnd two brave brothers held hands. And they sailed off to the most wonderful dreams.` }

      { text: `On the third night in their big bed, something funny happened.\n\nBenjamine dropped his stuffed animal, and it rolled right under the bed.\n\n"Uh oh," said Benjamine.\n\nChristopher leaned over the side and looked underneath. It was dark down there. A little dusty. A little shadowy.\n\nBut then he saw something he had never seen before.\n\nA tiny door.` },
      { text: `It was no bigger than a book, with a round golden handle and a keyhole shaped like a star.\n\nAnd then — click — it opened. All by itself.\n\nOut came a warm breeze that smelled like cookies and grass and rain. And then out hopped a small, round creature no bigger than a tennis ball.\n\nHe was covered in soft blue fur with two big eyes like marbles.\n\n"Oh! Oh! You found me!" he said. "I'm Tumble! I'm a Dream Keeper. I live under your bed."` },
      { text: `"Under this bed is the doorway," said Tumble. "I live on the other side. In the Underneath. Want to see?"\n\nChristopher looked at Benjamine. Benjamine looked at Christopher.\n\n"Together?" said Christopher.\n\n"Together," said Benjamine.\n\nThey held hands, leaned over the side of the bed, and — whooooop — tumbled softly, gently, through the tiny door.` },
      { text: `The Underneath was not dark at all.\n\nIt was enormous. A great, wide meadow lit by a sky full of floating lanterns — orange and purple and gold. Everywhere, little doors stuck up out of the ground like mailboxes.\n\n"Those are the doors to every child's bed in the whole world!" said Tumble. "And under every bed lives a Dream Keeper. I've been waiting three nights! Dream Keepers can only come out when the children are brave. And tonight — you were finally brave enough to find me."` },
      { text: `Tumble led them to the edge where a foggy patch swirled — grey and cold.\n\n"That's The Fog. If it covers the lanterns, no child gets good dreams. Inside is a golden lantern. If someone brave lights it, the fog goes away. But I'm too small. I need two children. One to hold the other up."\n\nThey walked in together. The fog whispered: What if it's too dark?\n\n"We have each other," said Christopher.\n\nWhat if Mommy and Daddy aren't here?\n\n"They're coming later," said Benjamine. "They always come."` },
      { text: `Christopher reached for the lantern. Too high.\n\n"Benji, climb on my back."\n\nBenjamine reached out and touched it.\n\nIt exploded with light. The fog turned into hundreds of glowing butterflies that scattered through every tiny door, into bedrooms all over the world.` },
      { text: `Back at their door, Tumble said: "Every single night. Right under your bed. Keeping your dreams safe. When your Mommy and Daddy come to bed later, I send them good dreams too. I'm very thorough."\n\nThey floated back up into bed. The blanket tucked itself around them.\n\nUnder the bed — the tiniest humming. No louder than a heartbeat.\n\nTumble. Keeping watch. All night long.` }

No brother is too small either."\n\nHe looked at Benjamine. Benjamine smiled so big his eyes crinkled.\n\nTwo new dream-bubbles floated up. Side by side.

Slower. "Ahhhhhhh." "Ahhhhhhhh."\n\nRubble curled around him like a big warm doughnut.\n\n"Is Christopher okay?" Looked over. Breathing soft.\n\n"And Mommy and Daddy?" "Coming soon.

Just Ryder on the edge of the bed.\n\n"This isn't a pup mission. I needed to talk to someone. And I thought of you."\n\n"Me?"\n\n"You're the only one who'd get it."` },
      { text: `"Everyone counts on me," said Ryder. "And sometimes at night... I think — what if one day I CAN'T fix it?"\n\n"YOU think that?"\n\n"Every night."\n\n"But you're RYDER. You saved a whale. You did a truck backflip."\n\n"That WAS pretty cool."\n\n"So how can you be scared?"\n\n"Being in charge doesn't mean you're not scared. It means you're scared AND you do the job anyway. That's what makes it brave."` },

But sometimes I'M scared and I can't tell anyone."\n\n"That's exactly how I feel about the pups," said Ryder.\n\n"Chase thinks I'm never scared. I let them think that because it helps them feel safe."\n\n"Yeah," said Christopher. "That's what I do for Benji."\n\n"That's why I came to YOU. You do the same job I do."` },
      { text: `"What do you do when your brain is loud?"\n\n"Three things. Breathe. Remember every time it WAS okay — and it's every time. And this."\n\nRyder handed him a note:\n\nYou are doing a great job. Benjamine is lucky to have you. — Ryder\n\n"I write notes when I'm brave. Then when I'm scared, I read them. Scared-me forgets things that brave-me knows."\n\n"Can I keep this?"\n\n"That one's yours."` },
      { text: `"Ryder? You're doing a great job too."\n\nRyder's chin wobbled. Then the big smile.\n\n"I've got your back, you've got mine. When it's hard — think of me in the Lookout doing the same thing. Together. Even from different places."\n\nA blue light on the ceiling — the Leader Light. Only two people have one.\n\n"It means: you're doing a great job. Even when it's hard. ESPECIALLY when it's hard."\n\nChristopher looked at Benjamine. Asleep. Safe.\n\nI did that, he thought. My job.\n\nAnd it felt like the best job in the world.` }

Every morning, Ryder drove them to the big red building and said goodbye and they ran inside.\n\nEvery pup except Chase.\n\nChase was holding onto Ryder's leg.\n\nNot a little bit. A LOT. Both paws wrapped around. Face buried in Ryder's knee. Not moving.\n\n"Chase," said Ryder. "It's time, buddy."\n\n"No."\n\n"The other pups are already inside."\n\n"I don't care."\n\n"You like Pup School. You told me yesterday you liked it."\n\n"I like it when I'm THERE. I don't like the part where you LEAVE."` },

He didn't pull Chase off. He didn't say "be brave." He didn't say "you're fine." He just knelt down and put his arms around Chase and held him.\n\n"I know," said Ryder.\n\n"You're going to LEAVE," said Chase. His voice was wobbly.\n\n"Yeah. I am."\n\n"What if something happens and you're not here?"\n\n"Your teachers are here."\n\n"They're not YOU."\n\nRyder didn't say anything for a second.

Fur messy from pressing it into Ryder's knee.\n\n"I don't like the leaving part either."\n\n"...You don't?"\n\n"Every morning I drive away and my tummy feels tight and I look in the mirror and the school gets smaller and I think — are they okay? Are my pups okay? And I feel like turning the truck around."\n\n"Then WHY DO YOU GO?"\n\n"Because I know you're safe. I KNOW it even when my tummy doesn't believe it. And because every single time — EVERY time — I come back."\n\n"Every time?"\n\n"Have I ever not come back?"\n\nChase thought. Really thought. Going through every day in his head.\n\n"...No."\n\n"Have I ever been late?"\n\n"...No."\n\n"And when I pick you up — what do you usually tell me?"\n\nChase's ears went a tiny bit less flat. "...I tell you about my day."\n\n"And is it usually a good day?"\n\n"...Yeah."\n\n"So the scary part — the part where I leave — it's the SHORTEST part. And then the good part starts."` },
      { text: `"But what do I do RIGHT NOW?" said Chase. "Right now my tummy is tight and my paws won't let go and my brain is saying DON'T LET HIM LEAVE."\n\n"Okay," said Ryder. "I'm going to teach you something. Just for us. Nobody else knows this."\n\nHe held up his hand.\n\n"Squeeze my hand. Three squeezes."\n\nChase put his paw in Ryder's hand. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\n"Know what that means?"\n\nChase shook his head.\n\n"That's our secret code. Three squeezes means I-LOVE-YOU. One squeeze for each word. Now — when I leave, I'm going to do three squeezes. And when I pick you up, first thing — three squeezes. And ANY time in the middle of the day when your tummy feels tight, you squeeze your OWN paw three times and remember — I just squeezed it this morning. Same squeeze. Still there."\n\n"It still counts if I do it myself?"\n\n"It still counts. Because you're remembering MY squeeze. You're carrying it with you."` },
      { text: `Chase looked at the big red building. The door was open. He could hear Marshall laughing inside. Something crashed. Probably Marshall.\n\n"It's still scary," said Chase.\n\n"I know."\n\n"My tummy is still tight."\n\n"I know. Being brave and being scared are the same thing, Chase. You just walk in while you're scared. That's all it is."\n\nChase let go of Ryder's leg. One paw at a time. Slow.\n\nRyder held out his hand.\n\nSqueeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\nChase squeezed back. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\n"I'll be here at pickup," said Ryder. "Same spot. First thing — three squeezes."\n\n"Promise?"\n\n"Every single day until you don't need it anymore. And probably after that too."` },

Turned around.\n\n"Ryder?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"When you're driving away and your tummy feels tight — YOU should squeeze your hand three times too."\n\nRyder's eyes went shiny. He didn't say anything for a second.\n\n"...Yeah. I'll do that."\n\nChase walked inside. The door closed.` },

Eye to eye.\n\n"I know, Christopher. I know it does."\n\nHe held out his hand.\n\n"Want to try?"\n\nSqueeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\nChristopher squeezed back. Harder than Chase. Three big squeezes.\n\nAnd for the first time that morning, his tummy didn't feel so tight.\n\nThree squeezes. I — Love — You. You're carrying it with you all day.` }

It floated through the gap and landed — POOF — on the end of Benjamine's bed.\n\nBenjamine sat up.\n\n"Christopher. There's a cloud on my bed."\n\n"Go to sleep, Benjamine."\n\n"There's a CLOUD on my BED."\n\nChristopher looked. There was, in fact, a cloud on Benjamine's bed.\n\n"...Oh."` },
      { text: `The cloud had a face. Two sleepy eyes. A little mouth. And it looked EXHAUSTED.\n\n"Sorry," said the cloud. "Sorry sorry sorry. I just need to sit down for a minute."\n\n"Are you okay?" said Christopher.\n\n"I've been floating ALL day. ALL day. Do you know how tiring it is being a cloud? Everyone thinks we just float around doing nothing but we have JOBS. I had to rain on a garden this morning. Then I had to make shade for a dog. Then the WIND pushed me halfway across the sky and I ended up HERE and I'm SO TIRED but I can't — I just CAN'T —"\n\n"Can't what?" said Benjamine.\n\n"I can't sleep."\n\nThe cloud's little eyes filled up with tiny raindrops. Not crying. Just... leaking.\n\n"Clouds don't really cry," she said. "We just rain a little bit when we're upset. Sorry about your blanket."` },
      { text: `"What's your name?" said Christopher.\n\n"Nimbus."\n\n"That's a funny name," said Benjamine.\n\n"It's a CLOUD name. All clouds have cloud names. My sister is called Cirrus. My brother is called Cumulus. My mum is called Big Brenda."\n\n"Big Brenda isn't a cloud name," said Christopher.\n\n"No. She just likes it."\n\nBenjamine laughed. Quiet laugh. Nighttime laugh.` },
      { text: `"Why can't you sleep?" said Christopher.\n\nNimbus puffed up a little. Then sank down.\n\n"Because it's too quiet up there. I float all by myself at night. No one to talk to. The stars don't talk — they just STARE. The moon is nice but he falls asleep before me EVERY time. And it's so dark and so big and I'm so small and I just float there thinking — what if I float away? What if I float somewhere I don't know? What if I can't find my way home?"\n\nShe was raining on the blanket again. Little drips.\n\nBenjamine reached out and touched her. She was soft. Really soft. Softer than anything he'd ever touched.\n\n"You feel like a pillow," said Benjamine.\n\n"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me."` },
      { text: `"We can help you sleep," said Christopher.\n\n"YOU can? But you're just boys."\n\n"We're REALLY good at sleeping," said Christopher. This was not exactly true. But tonight he felt like it could be.\n\n"Okay. Step one. You need to lie down."\n\nNimbus tried to lie down. She sort of... deflated. Like a beanbag. Then puffed back up.\n\n"I don't think I have bones," she said. "Lying down is hard when you don't have bones."\n\n"Just go flat," said Benjamine. He pushed her down gently with both hands. She went flat like a pancake on the bed.\n\n"Is this right?"\n\n"Perfect," said Christopher. "Step two. Close your eyes."\n\nNimbus closed her eyes. Then opened one.\n\n"What if I float away while they're closed?"\n\n"You won't. You're on Benjamine's bed. Beds don't float."\n\n"...That's a good point." She closed both eyes.` },
      { text: `"Step three," said Christopher. "Think of somewhere safe."\n\n"Somewhere safe?"\n\n"Where's your favourite place?"\n\nNimbus thought. "There's a spot. Above the hills. Where the warm air comes up in the afternoon and it holds you. Like a hug but made of air. And you can see the whole town and all the tiny houses and all the tiny people and everything looks soft from up there."\n\n"Think about that place," said Christopher.\n\n"I'm thinking about it."\n\n"Can you feel the warm air?"\n\n"...Yeah. I can."\n\n"That's where you are right now. You're there."\n\nBenjamine lay down next to Nimbus. Right next to her. His head was almost touching her.\n\n"Nimbus?" he whispered.\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"You're not by yourself."\n\n"I'm not?"\n\n"We're right here."\n\nNimbus opened her eyes. Just a little. She looked at Benjamine. His face was right there. Then she looked at Christopher. His face was right there too.\n\n"Oh," she said quietly. "This is much better than the sky."` },
      { text: `"One more thing," said Christopher. "Step four."\n\n"There's a step FOUR?"\n\n"The most important one. Take a big breath. Biiiiiig breath."\n\nNimbus breathed in. She puffed up. Bigger and bigger. Like a balloon.\n\n"Now let it out. Slow. Really slow."\n\nShe let it out. A tiny breeze came out of her. It smelled like rain. Good rain. Summer rain.\n\n"Again," said Christopher.\n\nShe breathed in. Puffed up. Let it out. The breeze ruffled Benjamine's hair.\n\n"Again."\n\nThis time when she breathed out, her eyes didn't open back up.\n\n"...Nimbus?" whispered Benjamine.\n\nA tiny snore. The softest sound. Like wind through a keyhole.\n\nShe was asleep.` },
      { text: `Benjamine smiled. He pulled his blanket up over both of them — him and the cloud. Christopher lay back down in his bed.\n\nThe room was quiet. The good kind of quiet.\n\n"Christopher?" whispered Benjamine.\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"We helped her."\n\n"Yeah. We did."\n\n"She was really scared."\n\n"Yeah. But she isn't now."\n\nBenjamine closed his eyes. His hand was resting on Nimbus. Soft. So soft.\n\n"Christopher?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"I'm not scared either."\n\n"Me neither, Benji."\n\nIn the morning the cloud was gone. Back in the sky. But the blanket was still a tiny bit damp. And if you looked out the window — way up high — there was one small cloud sitting right above their house.\n\nNot floating away.\n\nJust staying.` }

"AN UPSIDE DOWN BOY! That's the WORST kind!"\n\nGloop scrambled to the far corner under the bed. He was shaking.

One eye. Then two. Then all seven, poking out from under the bed like a bunch of green grapes.\n\nHe was small. Really small. About the size of Benjamine's shoe. He had little arms, little legs, and a tail that kept curling around his own body like a hug.\n\n"You're TINY," said Benjamine.\n\n"I'm NORMAL sized for a monster! YOU'RE the big ones! You're ENORMOUS! Look at you! You've got KNEES and everything!"\n\n"Everyone has knees," said Christopher.\n\n"Monsters DON'T. Knees are WEIRD."` },

My job is to EAT the scary things! Dust bunnies? I eat those. Bad smells? I eat those. Spiders? I eat those — well, small ones. Big ones I just stare at until they leave."\n\n"You EAT dust bunnies?" said Benjamine.\n\n"They're delicious. Crunchy on the outside, fluffy in the middle. Don't judge me."\n\n"So you PROTECT us?" said Christopher.\n\nGloop puffed up. All seven eyes went proud.\n\n"Every single night. I've been under here since before Benjamine could walk. I ate a dust bunny the size of MY HEAD last Tuesday. Did you say thank you? No. Because you didn't even know I was here. Which is how it's SUPPOSED to work except SOMEONE looked under the bed." He pointed all seven eyes at Benjamine.\n\n"Sorry," said Benjamine. He didn't look sorry.` },
      { text: `"Gloop," said Christopher. "If you protect us... who protects YOU?"\n\nGloop's seven eyes all went soft at the same time. That was a lot of soft eyes.\n\n"Nobody. That's — I mean — I'm fine. Monsters don't need protecting. We're monsters. We're TOUGH." His tail curled tighter around himself. "We're very tough."\n\nHe didn't look tough. He looked like a tiny green thing that needed a hug.\n\nBenjamine slid off the bed. Sat on the floor. Right next to Gloop.\n\nGloop FLINCHED.\n\n"What are you DOING?"\n\n"Sitting with you."\n\n"WHY?"\n\n"Because you're scared."\n\n"I'm NOT scared. I'm a MONSTER."\n\n"You're shaking."\n\n"...Monsters shake sometimes. It's a monster thing."\n\nBenjamine put his hand next to Gloop. Not on him. Just next to him. Close enough that Gloop could touch it if he wanted to.\n\nGloop looked at the hand. Then at Benjamine. Then at the hand.\n\nVery slowly, he put one tiny green finger on Benjamine's pinky.\n\n"Your skin is weird," said Gloop.\n\n"Your finger is sticky," said Benjamine.\n\n"...Deal," said Gloop.` },
      { text: `"Okay NEW RULES," said Gloop, suddenly standing up straight. "Rule one — do NOT look under the bed every night. I have a SYSTEM down here and I don't need you messing it up."\n\n"Okay," said Christopher.\n\n"Rule two — if you drop crumbs, drop them near the edge. I like the crunchy ones."\n\n"Okay," said Benjamine.\n\n"Rule three —" Gloop paused. His voice got small. "If you ever hear me shaking under there... you could maybe... talk to me? Just a little? You don't have to. I'm FINE. But. You know. If you wanted to."\n\n"We can do that," said Christopher.\n\n"It's not because I'm SCARED."\n\n"Obviously."\n\n"It's just nice to hear voices."\n\n"Obviously."\n\n"I'm a very tough monster."\n\n"The toughest," said Benjamine.` },

"Goodnight, Gloop."\n\nSilence. Then, very quietly from under the bed:\n\n"Goodnight, my boys."\n\nThen even quieter:\n\n"I mean — goodnight, THE boys. Not MY boys. You're not my boys. That would be weird. I'm a monster. Forget I said that."\n\n"Goodnight, OUR monster," said Christopher.\n\n"...Okay fine. Your monster. I'm your monster."\n\nAnd under the bed, a tiny green thing with seven eyes and no knees curled his tail around himself, smiled with all three of his mouths, and guarded them all night long.\n\nLike he did every night.\n\nLike he would every night after that.` }

And then something happened that has never happened before in the whole entire history of the world.\n\nThe moon moved.\n\nNot slowly, the way the moon normally moves. FAST. It dropped. Down, down, down through the sky like a ball falling off a table. And it landed — THOOMPH — right in their backyard.\n\nThe whole room went bright. Golden bright. Like morning but softer.` },
      { text: `They ran to the window.\n\nThe moon was sitting in the grass. It was HUGE. It took up the whole backyard.

"The moon is in our GARDEN."\n\n"I know."\n\n"Should we tell Daddy?"\n\nChristopher thought about it. "...Not yet."\n\nThey crept outside in their pyjamas. Bare feet on cold grass. The moon was warm, though. The closer they got, the warmer it was. Like standing near a fireplace. Their shadows stretched all the way back to the house.\n\nChristopher reached out and touched it.\n\nIt was smooth. And warm. And it hummed under his hand.

It's how I know you're alive. Every night I look through your window and I count — one boy, two boys, both breathing. Then I keep going across the sky."\n\nChristopher felt something funny in his chest. "You check on us?"\n\n"Every single night. I check on everyone. But I always look at your window first."` },
      { text: `"Why did you come down?" said Christopher.\n\nThe moon hummed for a long time.\n\n"I'm tired."\n\n"Tired?"\n\n"I've been up there a very long time, Christopher. A very, very long time. And it's beautiful — don't get me wrong. The stars are wonderful. The earth is the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen. But I've never... SAT down. I've never felt grass. I've never been close to the people I watch every night. I just wanted — just for one night — to be HERE. With someone. Instead of up THERE. By myself."\n\nBenjamine walked right up to the moon. He sat down against it. Leaned his back on it like a giant warm pillow.\n\n"You can sit with us," said Benjamine.\n\nThe moon's glow got a tiny bit brighter when he said that.` },

The hum got softer.\n\n"Sometimes. The stars are far apart. They're beautiful but they're far. And I can't visit. I just go round and round the same path every night. Same sky. Same view. Same journey."\n\n"That sounds boring," said Benjamine.\n\n"BENJAMIN," said Christopher.\n\n"No, he's right," said the moon. "It IS boring sometimes. But then I look down and I see something — a boy taking his first steps, or two brothers laughing in a bathtub, or a father carrying a sleeping child from the car to the bed — and I think, THAT'S why I'm up there. So I can see all of it."\n\n"You saw Benjamine's first steps?" said Christopher.\n\n"He fell down four times. Then he walked three steps.

I don't know how to go UP."\n\nChristopher looked at Benjamine. Benjamine looked at Christopher.\n\n"We'll push you," said Christopher.\n\n"You can't PUSH the moon."\n\n"We can try."` },

Small hands on something ancient and enormous.\n\n"Ready?" said Christopher.\n\n"This won't work," said the moon.\n\n"One... two... THREE."\n\nThey pushed. They pushed with everything. Feet digging into the grass. Arms shaking.\n\nThe moon didn't move.\n\n"See?" said the moon. "It's okay. I'll figure something —"\n\n"AGAIN," said Christopher. "Benjamine — PUSH."\n\n"I'M PUSHING!"\n\n"HARDER."\n\nAnd then — something. A wobble. A tiny little wobble. The hum got louder. The glow got brighter. And the moon lifted. Just a little. Off the grass.\n\n"YOU'RE DOING IT," said the moon.\n\nThey pushed harder. The moon rose. Past their heads. Past the roof. Past the tree. Slowly, slowly, like a balloon, the moon floated up. Higher. Higher.\n\nTheir hands couldn't reach anymore.\n\n"KEEP GOING!" yelled Christopher.\n\n"I AM!" said the moon. "I'm GOING!"\n\nHigher. Higher. Smaller now. Back where it belonged. Back in the sky.` },
      { text: `They stood in the backyard in their pyjamas, heads tilted all the way back, watching the moon settle into its spot.\n\nIt fit perfectly. Like it had never left.\n\nBut it looked different now. Brighter. Like it was smiling.\n\n"Moon?" yelled Christopher.\n\nNothing. Moons don't talk. Everyone knows that.\n\nBut the light got warmer for just a second. Just a little pulse. And both boys felt it on their faces.\n\nBenjamine's feet were cold. Christopher picked him up. Actually picked him up — which he almost never did because Benjamine was heavy.\n\n"Christopher?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"The moon knows our names."\n\n"Yeah."\n\n"It watches us every night."\n\n"Every night, Benji."\n\n"So we're never really by ourselves?"\n\nChristopher looked up at the moon. The moon looked back.\n\n"No. We're never really by ourselves."\n\nHe carried Benjamine inside. They climbed into bed. The room was dark again. Normal dark.\n\nBut through the window — right there, exactly where it always was — the moon.\n\nAnd if you looked closely, really closely, the light coming through the window landed right on their bed.\n\nRight on two boys.\n\nOne boy, two boys. Both breathing.` }
