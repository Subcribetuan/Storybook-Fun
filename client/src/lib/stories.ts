      { text: `Once upon a time, in a cozy house on a quiet street, there lived two brothers.\n\nThe big brother was named Christopher. He was strong and brave, and he loved to explore.\n\nThe little brother was named Benjamin. He was curious and silly, and he loved to follow Christopher everywhere.` },
      { text: `One evening, Mommy and Daddy tucked them into their big, warm bed together. Daddy pulled the blanket up to their chins — tuck, tuck, tuck — and kissed them both on the forehead.\n\n"We'll be right here," Daddy said. "And later tonight, we'll come snuggle with you."\n\n"But what if it's dark?" whispered Benjamin.\n\n"What if it's too quiet?" whispered Christopher.\n\nDaddy smiled. "You have each other. And that's a very powerful thing."` },
      { text: `Then Daddy turned off the light, and the room went dark and still, and the door closed with a gentle click.\n\nAnd that's when the magic happened.\n\nBenjamin reached over and held Christopher's hand.\n\nAnd the moment their fingers touched — whoooosh — the blanket began to glow. Soft, golden light floated up from the sheets like tiny fireflies, swirling around the room.` },
      { text: `"Whoa," said Christopher.\n\n"Whoa!" said Benjamin.\n\nThe blanket lifted — just a little — and became a tent. A great, billowing tent made of stars and moonlight. Inside, the bed wasn't a bed anymore.\n\nIt was a ship. A ship sailing on a silver sea, under a sky so full of stars they looked like spilled glitter.` },
      { text: `"Welcome aboard, brave brothers!" said a voice.\n\nSitting on the mast was a tiny owl with round golden glasses and a scarf that was way too long for him.\n\n"My name is Oliver," said the owl. "And I've been waiting for you."\n\n"You see, every night, when two brave children lie down together in their bed, they unlock the Night Sea. But it only works if they're together. One brother alone can't do it. It takes two."` },
      { text: `Oliver pointed toward the horizon, where a soft, golden light was glowing.\n\n"That is the Island of Safe Dreams. It's where all the best dreams are made. And tonight, you two get to pick yours."\n\nThe silver sea was calm and kind. Little fish with glowing fins jumped alongside their ship, and the waves made a sound like someone whispering shhhhh, shhhhh, shhhhh.` },
      { text: `"Are there any monsters in the water?" Benjamin asked quietly.\n\nOliver laughed. "There used to be a monster. A big, grumbly shadow called The Worried Wobble. He liked to make children feel scared at nighttime."\n\n"But two brave children — just like you — held hands one night and sailed right past him. And when The Worried Wobble saw that they weren't alone — that they had each other — he got smaller and smaller until the wind blew him away."\n\n"You mean... he's scared of US?" said Christopher.\n\n"Absolutely terrified," said Oliver with a wink.` },
      { text: `On the Island of Safe Dreams, the sand was softer than pillows and the trees chimed like tiny bells.\n\n"You each get to pick one dream for tonight. Close your eyes and think of the happiest thing you can imagine."\n\nTwo glowing orbs floated in front of them — one blue, one gold.\n\n"Those are your dreams," said Oliver. "They'll be waiting for you the moment you fall asleep."` },
      { text: `The ship sailed them back. The stars dimmed one by one. The blanket tucked around them again.\n\n"Will you be here tomorrow night?" asked Christopher.\n\n"Every night," said Oliver. "Every single night you're brave enough to lie down together."\n\n"Your Mommy and Daddy? They sailed this same sea once. That's why they know you'll be okay. And later, when they come to sleep beside you, they'll be joining you on the island. You just get there first."\n\nAnd two brave brothers held hands. And they sailed off to the most wonderful dreams.` }

      { text: `On the third night in their big bed, something funny happened.\n\nBenjamin dropped his stuffed animal, and it rolled right under the bed.\n\n"Uh oh," said Benjamin.\n\nChristopher leaned over the side and looked underneath. It was dark down there. A little dusty. A little shadowy.\n\nBut then he saw something he had never seen before.\n\nA tiny door.` },
      { text: `It was no bigger than a book, with a round golden handle and a keyhole shaped like a star.\n\nAnd then — click — it opened. All by itself.\n\nOut came a warm breeze that smelled like cookies and grass and rain. And then out hopped a small, round creature no bigger than a tennis ball.\n\nHe was covered in soft blue fur with two big eyes like marbles.\n\n"Oh! Oh! You found me!" he said. "I'm Tumble! I'm a Dream Keeper. I live under your bed."` },
      { text: `"Under this bed is the doorway," said Tumble. "I live on the other side. In the Underneath. Want to see?"\n\nChristopher looked at Benjamin. Benjamin looked at Christopher.\n\n"Together?" said Christopher.\n\n"Together," said Benjamin.\n\nThey held hands, leaned over the side of the bed, and — whooooop — tumbled softly, gently, through the tiny door.` },
      { text: `The Underneath was not dark at all.\n\nIt was enormous. A great, wide meadow lit by a sky full of floating lanterns — orange and purple and gold. Everywhere, little doors stuck up out of the ground like mailboxes.\n\n"Those are the doors to every child's bed in the whole world!" said Tumble. "And under every bed lives a Dream Keeper. I've been waiting three nights! Dream Keepers can only come out when the children are brave. And tonight — you were finally brave enough to find me."` },
      { text: `Tumble led them to the edge where a foggy patch swirled — grey and cold.\n\n"That's The Fog. If it covers the lanterns, no child gets good dreams. Inside is a golden lantern. If someone brave lights it, the fog goes away. But I'm too small. I need two children. One to hold the other up."\n\nThey walked in together. The fog whispered: What if it's too dark?\n\n"We have each other," said Christopher.\n\nWhat if Mommy and Daddy aren't here?\n\n"They're coming later," said Benjamin. "They always come."` },
      { text: `Christopher reached for the lantern. Too high.\n\n"Benji, climb on my back."\n\nBenjamin reached out and touched it.\n\nIt exploded with light. The fog turned into hundreds of glowing butterflies that scattered through every tiny door, into bedrooms all over the world.` },
      { text: `Back at their door, Tumble said: "Every single night. Right under your bed. Keeping your dreams safe. When your Mommy and Daddy come to bed later, I send them good dreams too. I'm very thorough."\n\nThey floated back up into bed. The blanket tucked itself around them.\n\nUnder the bed — the tiniest humming. No louder than a heartbeat.\n\nTumble. Keeping watch. All night long.` }

Gone.\n\nRyder whispered: "You made them feel safe. The hardest mission there is."\n\n"No job is too big, no pup is too small. But tonight I learned something new. No brother is too small either."\n\nHe looked at Benjamin. Benjamin smiled so big his eyes crinkled.\n\nTwo new dream-bubbles floated up. Side by side.

It means you're scared AND you do the job anyway. That's what makes it brave."` },

But sometimes I'M scared and I can't tell anyone."\n\n"That's exactly how I feel about the pups," said Ryder.\n\n"Chase thinks I'm never scared. I let them think that because it helps them feel safe."\n\n"Yeah," said Christopher. "That's what I do for Benji."\n\n"That's why I came to YOU. You do the same job I do."` },

And this."\n\nRyder handed him a note:\n\nYou are doing a great job. Benjamin is lucky to have you. — Ryder\n\n"I write notes when I'm brave. Then when I'm scared, I read them. Scared-me forgets things that brave-me knows."\n\n"Can I keep this?"\n\n"That one's yours."` },

When it's hard — think of me in the Lookout doing the same thing. Together. Even from different places."\n\nA blue light on the ceiling — the Leader Light. Only two people have one.\n\n"It means: you're doing a great job. Even when it's hard. ESPECIALLY when it's hard."\n\nChristopher looked at Benjamin. Asleep. Safe.\n\nI did that, he thought. My job.\n\nAnd it felt like the best job in the world.` }

      { text: `Chase had to go to Pup School.\n\nEvery pup went. Marshall went. Skye went. Rubble went. Every morning, Ryder drove them to the big red building and said goodbye and they ran inside.\n\nEvery pup except Chase.\n\nChase was holding onto Ryder's leg.\n\nNot a little bit. A LOT. Both paws wrapped around. Face buried in Ryder's knee. Not moving.\n\n"Chase," said Ryder. "It's time, buddy."\n\n"No."\n\n"The other pups are already inside."\n\n"I don't care."\n\n"You like Pup School. You told me yesterday you liked it."\n\n"I like it when I'm THERE. I don't like the part where you LEAVE."` },
      { text: `Christopher was watching from the gate. He didn't say anything. He just watched.\n\nBecause he knew exactly how Chase felt.\n\nRyder knelt down. Right there on the ground. He didn't pull Chase off. He didn't say "be brave." He didn't say "you're fine." He just knelt down and put his arms around Chase and held him.\n\n"I know," said Ryder.\n\n"You're going to LEAVE," said Chase. His voice was wobbly.\n\n"Yeah. I am."\n\n"What if something happens and you're not here?"\n\n"Your teachers are here."\n\n"They're not YOU."\n\nRyder didn't say anything for a second. Because that one was true and they both knew it.` },
      { text: `"Chase? Can I tell you a secret?"\n\nChase looked up. Eyes wet. Fur messy from pressing it into Ryder's knee.\n\n"I don't like the leaving part either."\n\n"...You don't?"\n\n"Every morning I drive away and my tummy feels tight and I look in the mirror and the school gets smaller and I think — are they okay? Are my pups okay? And I feel like turning the truck around."\n\n"Then WHY DO YOU GO?"\n\n"Because I know you're safe. I KNOW it even when my tummy doesn't believe it. And because every single time — EVERY time — I come back."\n\n"Every time?"\n\n"Have I ever not come back?"\n\nChase thought. Really thought. Going through every day in his head.\n\n"...No."\n\n"Have I ever been late?"\n\n"...No."\n\n"And when I pick you up — what do you usually tell me?"\n\nChase's ears went a tiny bit less flat. "...I tell you about my day."\n\n"And is it usually a good day?"\n\n"...Yeah."\n\n"So the scary part — the part where I leave — it's the SHORTEST part. And then the good part starts."` },
      { text: `"But what do I do RIGHT NOW?" said Chase. "Right now my tummy is tight and my paws won't let go and my brain is saying DON'T LET HIM LEAVE."\n\n"Okay," said Ryder. "I'm going to teach you something. Just for us. Nobody else knows this."\n\nHe held up his hand.\n\n"Squeeze my hand. Three squeezes."\n\nChase put his paw in Ryder's hand. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\n"Know what that means?"\n\nChase shook his head.\n\n"That's our secret code. Three squeezes means I-LOVE-YOU. One squeeze for each word. Now — when I leave, I'm going to do three squeezes. And when I pick you up, first thing — three squeezes. And ANY time in the middle of the day when your tummy feels tight, you squeeze your OWN paw three times and remember — I just squeezed it this morning. Same squeeze. Still there."\n\n"It still counts if I do it myself?"\n\n"It still counts. Because you're remembering MY squeeze. You're carrying it with you."` },
      { text: `Chase looked at the big red building. The door was open. He could hear Marshall laughing inside. Something crashed. Probably Marshall.\n\n"It's still scary," said Chase.\n\n"I know."\n\n"My tummy is still tight."\n\n"I know. Being brave and being scared are the same thing, Chase. You just walk in while you're scared. That's all it is."\n\nChase let go of Ryder's leg. One paw at a time. Slow.\n\nRyder held out his hand.\n\nSqueeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\nChase squeezed back. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\n"I'll be here at pickup," said Ryder. "Same spot. First thing — three squeezes."\n\n"Promise?"\n\n"Every single day until you don't need it anymore. And probably after that too."` },
      { text: `Chase walked to the door. Stopped. Turned around.\n\n"Ryder?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"When you're driving away and your tummy feels tight — YOU should squeeze your hand three times too."\n\nRyder's eyes went shiny. He didn't say anything for a second.\n\n"...Yeah. I'll do that."\n\nChase walked inside. The door closed.` },
      { text: `Christopher was still standing at the gate. Quiet.\n\n"He was really scared," said Christopher.\n\n"Yeah," said Ryder. "He was."\n\n"But he went in."\n\n"He did."\n\n"Does his tummy really get tight?"\n\n"Every single morning."\n\n"...Mine does too."\n\nRyder knelt down again. Same way he knelt for Chase. Eye to eye.\n\n"I know, Christopher. I know it does."\n\nHe held out his hand.\n\n"Want to try?"\n\nSqueeze. Squeeze. Squeeze.\n\nChristopher squeezed back. Harder than Chase. Three big squeezes.\n\nAnd for the first time that morning, his tummy didn't feel so tight.\n\nThree squeezes. I — Love — You. You're carrying it with you all day.` }

      { text: `The window was open just a little bit. Just enough for the breeze to come in.\n\nBut tonight something else came in too.\n\nA cloud. A small one. About the size of a pillow. It floated through the gap and landed — POOF — on the end of Benjamin's bed.\n\nBenjamin sat up.\n\n"Christopher. There's a cloud on my bed."\n\n"Go to sleep, Benjamin."\n\n"There's a CLOUD on my BED."\n\nChristopher looked. There was, in fact, a cloud on Benjamin's bed.\n\n"...Oh."` },
      { text: `The cloud had a face. Two sleepy eyes. A little mouth. And it looked EXHAUSTED.\n\n"Sorry," said the cloud. "Sorry sorry sorry. I just need to sit down for a minute."\n\n"Are you okay?" said Christopher.\n\n"I've been floating ALL day. ALL day. Do you know how tiring it is being a cloud? Everyone thinks we just float around doing nothing but we have JOBS. I had to rain on a garden this morning. Then I had to make shade for a dog. Then the WIND pushed me halfway across the sky and I ended up HERE and I'm SO TIRED but I can't — I just CAN'T —"\n\n"Can't what?" said Benjamin.\n\n"I can't sleep."\n\nThe cloud's little eyes filled up with tiny raindrops. Not crying. Just... leaking.\n\n"Clouds don't really cry," she said. "We just rain a little bit when we're upset. Sorry about your blanket."` },
      { text: `"What's your name?" said Christopher.\n\n"Nimbus."\n\n"That's a funny name," said Benjamin.\n\n"It's a CLOUD name. All clouds have cloud names. My sister is called Cirrus. My brother is called Cumulus. My mum is called Big Brenda."\n\n"Big Brenda isn't a cloud name," said Christopher.\n\n"No. She just likes it."\n\nBenjamin laughed. Quiet laugh. Nighttime laugh.` },
      { text: `"Why can't you sleep?" said Christopher.\n\nNimbus puffed up a little. Then sank down.\n\n"Because it's too quiet up there. I float all by myself at night. No one to talk to. The stars don't talk — they just STARE. The moon is nice but he falls asleep before me EVERY time. And it's so dark and so big and I'm so small and I just float there thinking — what if I float away? What if I float somewhere I don't know? What if I can't find my way home?"\n\nShe was raining on the blanket again. Little drips.\n\nBenjamin reached out and touched her. She was soft. Really soft. Softer than anything he'd ever touched.\n\n"You feel like a pillow," said Benjamin.\n\n"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me."` },
      { text: `"We can help you sleep," said Christopher.\n\n"YOU can? But you're just boys."\n\n"We're REALLY good at sleeping," said Christopher. This was not exactly true. But tonight he felt like it could be.\n\n"Okay. Step one. You need to lie down."\n\nNimbus tried to lie down. She sort of... deflated. Like a beanbag. Then puffed back up.\n\n"I don't think I have bones," she said. "Lying down is hard when you don't have bones."\n\n"Just go flat," said Benjamin. He pushed her down gently with both hands. She went flat like a pancake on the bed.\n\n"Is this right?"\n\n"Perfect," said Christopher. "Step two. Close your eyes."\n\nNimbus closed her eyes. Then opened one.\n\n"What if I float away while they're closed?"\n\n"You won't. You're on Benjamin's bed. Beds don't float."\n\n"...That's a good point." She closed both eyes.` },
      { text: `"Step three," said Christopher. "Think of somewhere safe."\n\n"Somewhere safe?"\n\n"Where's your favourite place?"\n\nNimbus thought. "There's a spot. Above the hills. Where the warm air comes up in the afternoon and it holds you. Like a hug but made of air. And you can see the whole town and all the tiny houses and all the tiny people and everything looks soft from up there."\n\n"Think about that place," said Christopher.\n\n"I'm thinking about it."\n\n"Can you feel the warm air?"\n\n"...Yeah. I can."\n\n"That's where you are right now. You're there."\n\nBenjamin lay down next to Nimbus. Right next to her. His head was almost touching her.\n\n"Nimbus?" he whispered.\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"You're not by yourself."\n\n"I'm not?"\n\n"We're right here."\n\nNimbus opened her eyes. Just a little. She looked at Benjamin. His face was right there. Then she looked at Christopher. His face was right there too.\n\n"Oh," she said quietly. "This is much better than the sky."` },
      { text: `"One more thing," said Christopher. "Step four."\n\n"There's a step FOUR?"\n\n"The most important one. Take a big breath. Biiiiiig breath."\n\nNimbus breathed in. She puffed up. Bigger and bigger. Like a balloon.\n\n"Now let it out. Slow. Really slow."\n\nShe let it out. A tiny breeze came out of her. It smelled like rain. Good rain. Summer rain.\n\n"Again," said Christopher.\n\nShe breathed in. Puffed up. Let it out. The breeze ruffled Benjamin's hair.\n\n"Again."\n\nThis time when she breathed out, her eyes didn't open back up.\n\n"...Nimbus?" whispered Benjamin.\n\nA tiny snore. The softest sound. Like wind through a keyhole.\n\nShe was asleep.` },
      { text: `Benjamin smiled. He pulled his blanket up over both of them — him and the cloud. Christopher lay back down in his bed.\n\nThe room was quiet. The good kind of quiet.\n\n"Christopher?" whispered Benjamin.\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"We helped her."\n\n"Yeah. We did."\n\n"She was really scared."\n\n"Yeah. But she isn't now."\n\nBenjamin closed his eyes. His hand was resting on Nimbus. Soft. So soft.\n\n"Christopher?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"I'm not scared either."\n\n"Me neither, Benji."\n\nIn the morning the cloud was gone. Back in the sky. But the blanket was still a tiny bit damp. And if you looked out the window — way up high — there was one small cloud sitting right above their house.\n\nNot floating away.\n\nJust staying.` }
